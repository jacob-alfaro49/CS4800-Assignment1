**Total # of Hours for Completion:** 3.9 hours<br />
Bugs/Defects Found:<br />
1. Trigonometry functions not being evaluated properly
2. Pi was treated as a different value each time an expression was calculated
3. Eulerâ€™s number was treated as a different value each time an expression was calculated
4. Sometimes a calculation would return words even though the prompt specified just returning values
5. If the calculation wasn't exact, the screen would display "Error"

**Comparison of Estimate vs. Actual Time Spent**<br />
My original estimate for time spent was 6 hours as I never worked with the OpenAI API so I wanted a comfortable estimate on how long it would take me to learn. The documentation provided also did not contain Java implementation so I thought it would take longer to implement. It turned out that OpenAI had an official Github repository for Java implementation allowing me to accelerate adding OpenAI to my project. That is the real difference between the comparison and actual time spent as the API incorporation was quicker than expected and I also figured UI would be simple to implement.
